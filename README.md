## what and why

Traditionally clicking a link in a website will direct the browser from one page to the next. With something like Angular or Vue, a click might replace the content of an element... which can appear similar to loading new page, but without a need to reload the page.

This _great panes_ experiment explores the idea of loading all "pages" into the browser as "panes". These panes all exist in the browser after the initial load. Panes are positioned out of view, and a click brings a pane in/out of view.

For experimental purposes, _great panes_ had a nav centered on the page. This allows us to click pieces and see the result.  Also, a more realistic pane transition happens behind the nav.
